"""Address models — Sprint 2.4 (Checkout & Order Creation).

Mirrors `SavedAddress` / `AddressDraft` in
`backend/src/customer/addresses-api.ts`, so the checkout address book renders
identically from the mock router and from FastAPI.

    GET    /api/addresses
    POST   /api/addresses
    PUT    /api/addresses/{id}
    DELETE /api/addresses/{id}
